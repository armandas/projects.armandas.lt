HD44780 LCD driver library for PIC18 microcontrollers
=====================================================

:date: 14 August, 2010

This project implements a simple library for interfacing to HD44780-compatible
LCD displays. The code was tested on PIC18F4550 and PIC18F66K22
microcontrollers. Some of the features:

   * LCD initialization
   * Sending commands and data
   * Ability to write strings to the LCD
   * Ability to move cursor to a selected location
   * Custom character loading
