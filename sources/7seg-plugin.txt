7-segment LED display for Spartan-3E dev board
==============================================

:date: July 17, 2009

During the preparation for my :ref:`third year project <third-year-project>`
I was playing around with the Xilinx Spartan-3E development board. The book
I used had some application examples for 7-segment displays, which were not
available on the S3E board. I had some of these LED displays in my parts box
and decided to build a plugin (picture below).

The displays are multiplexed in order to reduce the number of I/O pins used.
