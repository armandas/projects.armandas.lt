Small-scale Biofuel Production
==============================

MEng students at Sussex do group projects of their choice. Our group chose
to work on a Small-scale Biofuel Production unit, that converts organic
household waste to bio-ethanol. The group was formed of four students - two
electronic and two mechanical engineers.

Introduction
------------

The Small-scale biofuel production project has been running since 2008, and our
group was the third one to work on this project. The running-goal is to design
a unit that can convert biodegradable municipal waste to ethanol efficiently
and with minimum human intervention.

While the previous groups focused on producing ethanol at the end of the year,
our group decided that this time most of the work should be done on designing
and building a biofuel production unit, that could be further improved by the
future groups. This decision was mainly influenced by the number of flaws in
the previous design.

This document will focus on electronics/control system design and only touch
on electrical and mechanical parts of the projetc. Full details are provided
in the dissertation, which can be downloaded in PDF format. The links are
provided at the bottom of this page.

Control board
-------------

The control board was designed to replace the mess of veroboards, wires and
blue-tack that was left to us by the previous group. The board contains most
of the circuitry that is required to control a biofuel production process.

The main reatures of the control board are:
   * Power supply circuitry with a maximum input voltage of 34 volts
   * PIC18F66K22 microcontroller with a 16MHz crystal
   * Five thermocouple channels for temperature measurement
   * Seven open-drain outputs for driving optocouplers (electrical interface)
   * HD44780-compatible LCD and four-button keypad interfaces
   * Real time clock with an external 32.768kHz crystal
   * microSD card slot wired for SPI communication

The schematic and PCB design was done using Altium Designer. The design files
can be downloaded from the links at the bottom of this page.

Keyboard PCB
------------

The user interface of the control system consists of two parts: an LCD and
a keyboard. The LCD is a standard 4x20 character display with
HD44780-compatible controller. The keyboard is just four tactile switches
mounted on a PCB.

The design of the keyboard PCB is very simple so it was made at home
using a DIY :ref:`pcb-exposure-box` and some chemicals.

Below is the picture of the PCB with the SMT components soldered on.

Enclosure of the control system
-------------------------------

To make the product look more complete, an enclosure is required. The
control system will contain the main control PCB, an LCD and a keyboard.
These components will be hosted in a specially prepared box.

It was decided that a metal chassis will be used to mount the PCBs, while the
chassis itself will be fixed to the box. The reasons for using a chassis are:

    #. Tidier, more compact arrangement inside the box. Were the chassis not
       used, the main PCB would have to be mounted to the back of the box,
       making the maintenance more awkward.
    #. Conductive chassis improves electrical and EMC performance of the
       system, as described in [#]_.

Based on the dimensions of the LCD and the keyboard, an off-the-shelf box
was chosen. The metal cover from an old CD player was used as a source
material for the chassis. A rectangular plate was cut out using a Dremel hand
tool and cutting discs.

The picture below shows a finished chassis, after the edges have been filed,
paint sanded-off, screw holes drilled and cable connector slots cut.

After the LCD and the keyboard were mounted on the chassis, appropriate holes
could be cut in the box. Below, you can see how the front and the inside of
the enclosure look like.

Firmware
--------

Rewriting the firmware was also a significant part of the control system
design. The previous group had their firmware developed in assembly, but due
to lack of documentation and general readability of the code, it was decided
that the firmware should be re-developed in C. As a result, a simple framework
that enables developers to utilise most of the hardware, was developed. The
code base contains functions for interfacing to the ADC and temperature
measurement circuitry, LCD and keypad support, control of electrical devices
and so on.

The code can be downloaded from the links at the bottom of this page.

Electrical system
-----------------

My colleague was responsible for the electrical part of the project. The
control unit interfaces to the electrical system in order to control various
electrical and electromechanical parts. The two systems are galvanically
isolated using optocouplers.

The major part of the electrical side is made of switching devices: relays and
TRIACs. Relays are used to control motors and solenoid valves, while heaters
are controlled by TRIACs. The electrical system also implements a zero-crossing
detector which generates a pulse on every zero crossing of the mains voltage.
This enables the control system to precisely adjust the power applied to the
heaters using a phase-fired control method.

More details on the electrical design can be found in the project report.

Mechanical part
---------------

The mechanical construction is shown below. More details on the mechanical and
structural design can be found in the dissertation. High resolution pictures
are available in the photo gallery.
