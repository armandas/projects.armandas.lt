Fume extractor
==============

:date: August 7, 2009

Ever since I got my first soldering iron, I was thinking about a fume
extractor. One week I got most of the parts that I needed to build one
and so this project was born.

The box is made of honeycomb cardboard, which is strong, but lightweight.
The fan is a standard computer cooler rated at 10V 150mA. Power supply
outputs 14V, 1.2A, current is limited by a 100-ohm resistor.

The flexible pipe is attached using a pair of neodymium magnets and can be
stored in the box when not in use:
